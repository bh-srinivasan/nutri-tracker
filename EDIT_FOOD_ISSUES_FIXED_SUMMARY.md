# Edit Food Form - Issues Fixed Summary

## Issues Reported and Resolved

### Issue 1: ❌ Incorrect Placement of "Add New Serving" Form
**Problem:** After the initial fix, the "Add New Serving" form was moved below the "Update Food" button, which was incorrect placement.

**Root Cause:** In the attempt to fix the nested forms issue, the serving form was placed outside the servings panel.

**Solution Applied:** ✅
- Moved the "Add New Serving" form back to its correct location within the Servings panel
- Ensured it remains outside the main food form to prevent nesting
- Maintained proper visual organization within the servings card

### Issue 2: ❌ No Toast Message and Incorrect Redirect Behavior  
**Problem:** When clicking "Update Food", there was no success toast message and the page wasn't staying on the edit food page.

**Root Cause:** The backend was working correctly (redirecting back to edit page with flash message), but the form structure issues were preventing proper functionality.

**Solution Applied:** ✅
- Fixed the form structure to eliminate nested forms
- Verified that flash messages are properly displayed via the base template
- Ensured redirect goes back to the edit food page with success message

## Technical Changes Made

### File: `app/templates/admin/edit_food.html`

**Before (Problematic Structure):**
```html
<form method="POST" data-food-id="{{ food.id }}">
    <!-- Food fields -->
    
    <!-- Servings Panel -->
    <div class="card">
        <!-- Servings table -->
        
        <!-- NESTED FORM - INVALID HTML -->
        <form id="add-serving-form">
            <!-- Serving fields -->
        </form>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Submit buttons -->
</form>
```

**After (Fixed Structure):**
```html
<form method="POST" data-food-id="{{ food.id }}">
    <!-- Food fields -->
    
    <!-- Submit buttons -->
    <div class="d-grid gap-2 d-md-flex justify-content-md-end">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-warning">Update Food</button>
    </div>
</form>

<!-- Servings Panel (separate from main form) -->
<div class="card mt-4">
    <div class="card-header">Servings</div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <!-- Servings table -->
        
        <!-- Add New Serving Form (outside main form) -->
        <form id="add-serving-form">
            <!-- Serving fields -->
        </form>
    </div>
</div>
```
