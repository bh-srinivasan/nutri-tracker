# Unified Food Uploads Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully merged Bulk Upload and Upload Jobs into a unified "Food Uploads" menu item with a tabbed interface for better user experience and improved functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Unified Interface
- **Single Menu Item**: "Food Uploads" replaces separate "Bulk Upload" and "Upload Jobs" entries
- **Tabbed Layout**: Bootstrap 5 tabs for "Upload" and "History" sections
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with proper spacing
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional appearance with consistent styling

### 2. Upload Tab Features
- **File Upload**: CSV file selection with validation
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars for upload status
- **Success/Error Display**: Clear feedback messages with toast notifications
- **Job Status Updates**: Live updates during processing

### 3. History Tab Features
- **Job History Table**: Complete list of all upload jobs
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status badges (Success, Failed, Processing, Pending)
- **Detailed Information**: File names, row counts, timestamps
- **Pagination**: Efficient browsing of upload history
- **Quick Actions**: View details and download error reports

### 4. Enhanced Backend
- **Unified Route**: `/admin/food-uploads` handles both upload and history
- **Tab Support**: URL parameter `?tab=history` for direct history access
- **Improved Status Tracking**: Uses correct attribute names (processed_rows, successful_rows, failed_rows)
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and logging

## Technical Implementation

### Key Fixes Applied
