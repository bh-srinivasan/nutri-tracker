# Warning Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Selenium Import Warnings ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The `test_password_reset_ux_improvement.py` file contained imports for Selenium packages that were not installed, causing 6 import resolution warnings:

- `selenium.webdriver.common.by`  
- `selenium.webdriver.support.ui`
- `selenium.webdriver.support`
