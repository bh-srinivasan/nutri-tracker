2. JavaScript validates input client-side
3. AJAX request sent to appropriate endpoint
4. Server processes request and updates database
5. JSON response returned to client
6. UI updated based on response

### Security & Validation
- Admin authentication required
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- CSRF protection via Flask-WTF
- Referential integrity maintained

## üéâ Success Metrics
