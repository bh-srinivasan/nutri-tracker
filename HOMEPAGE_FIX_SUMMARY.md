# Homepage UndefinedError Fix Summary

## Problem
When accessing the homepage, the application crashed with this error:

```
jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'current_datetime' is undefined
```

The error occurred in the dashboard template at line 114:
```jinja2
<small class="text-muted">{{ current_datetime.strftime('%B %d, %Y') }}</small>
```

## Root Cause
The dashboard route in `app/dashboard/routes.py` was not passing the `current_datetime` variable to the template, but the template was trying to use it to display the current date.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Backend Route
**File**: `app/dashboard/routes.py`

**Before** (missing current_datetime):
```python
return render_template('dashboard/index.html', title='Dashboard',
                     today_nutrition=today_nutrition, current_goal=current_goal,
                     progress=progress, streak=streak, user_challenges=user_challenges,
                     meals_by_type=meals_by_type)
```

**After** (includes current_datetime):
```python
return render_template('dashboard/index.html', title='Dashboard',
                     today_nutrition=today_nutrition, current_goal=current_goal,
                     progress=progress, streak=streak, user_challenges=user_challenges,
                     meals_by_type=meals_by_type, current_datetime=datetime.now())
```

### Dependencies
- The `datetime` module was already imported: `from datetime import datetime, date, timedelta`
- No template changes were needed since the usage was correct

## Files Modified
1. **app/dashboard/routes.py**: Added `current_datetime=datetime.now()` to template context

## Previous Fixes Applied
This build also includes the previous fix for the progress dictionary issue:
- ✅ Progress dictionary initialized with default values
- ✅ Template uses correct dictionary syntax (`progress['calories']` instead of `progress.calories`)

## Testing
The fix was verified using automated tests that confirmed:
- ✅ `current_datetime` is passed to template
- ✅ `datetime` module is properly imported  
- ✅ Template uses correct date formatting
- ✅ All required variables are present

## How to Test Manually

### Method 1: Command Line
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:/Users/bhsrinivasan/Downloads/Learning/Vibe Coding/Nutri_Tracker"

# Start the server using the virtual environment
".venv/Scripts/python.exe" app.py

# Open browser and go to:
# http://localhost:5001
```

### Method 2: VS Code
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Make sure the Python interpreter is set to the virtual environment
3. Run `app.py` in the terminal
4. Access `http://localhost:5001` in your browser

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Homepage Access**: 
   - Unauthenticated users: See welcome/login page
   - Regular users: Redirect to user dashboard
   - Admin users: Redirect to admin dashboard

2. **Dashboard Display**:
   - Current date displays correctly in "Today's Meals" section
   - Progress bars show correctly (0% if no goals, actual % if goals exist)
   - No template errors

3. **Error Prevention**:
   - ✅ No more `UndefinedError: 'current_datetime' is undefined`
   - ✅ No more `'dict object' has no attribute 'calories'`
   - ✅ Clean dashboard rendering for all users

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get module errors:
```bash
# Install dependencies
".venv/Scripts/pip.exe" install -r requirements.txt
```

### If you get permission errors:
```bash
# Run as administrator or check file permissions
```

### If the database is missing:
The app should create the database automatically on first run. If not, check that the `instance` directory exists.

## Technical Notes

- **Virtual Environment**: The project uses a Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- **Database**: SQLite database in `instance/nutri_tracker.db`
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates with proper error handling
- **Security**: All previous security features maintained

## Summary
This fix resolves the homepage crash by ensuring all required variables are passed to the dashboard template. The application should now load correctly for all user types without template errors.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for testing - Homepage should work correctly now!
