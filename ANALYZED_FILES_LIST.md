## Key Finding Summary

**Root Cause**: The JavaScript event binding in `admin.js` is too complex and fails to properly handle clicks on the delete button icon (`<i class="fas fa-trash"></i>`).

**Primary Issue Location**: 
- File: `app/static/js/admin.js`
- Lines: 1080-1105 (event delegation logic)
- Problem: When user clicks the trash icon, `e.target` is the `<i>` element, not the button with `data-serving-id`

**Fix Required**: Simplify event binding to use `e.target.closest('.delete-serving-btn')` instead of complex condition checks.
